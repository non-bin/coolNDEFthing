# Cool NDEF Thing

A (hopfully) highly feature-packed NDEF applet, [available through Fidesmo](https://apps.fidesmo.com/8210647A)
A constant work in progress, but I use it personally.

### Credits

This project is based on [OpenJavaCard NDEF](https://github.com/OpenJavaCard/openjavacard-ndef), which contains some code from the fine [IsoApplet](https://github.com/philipWendland/IsoApplet).
